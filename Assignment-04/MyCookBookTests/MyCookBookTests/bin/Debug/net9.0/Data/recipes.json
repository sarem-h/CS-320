In a large skillet, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat and brown the ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking them up as they cook. Once fully cooked, drain any excess grease and stir in the tomato sauce, sliced mushrooms, and a sprinkle of garlic salt, letting it simmer for a few minutes. In a baking dish, spread a layer of the meat sauce at the bottom, followed by a layer of noodles. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce on top. Cover with foil and bake at 375\u00B0F (190\u00B0C) for about 30-40 minutes. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
